# 16-FA25-SP26-WSU-CYBER



\## Project Summary



\### One-Sentence Description

A research driven software system exploring how adversarial transformations can hide an authorâ€™s identity in source code while preserving its functionality.



\### Extended Description

This project investigates \*\*adversarial stylometry\*\* techniques for evading authorship attribution models applied to source code.  

The system aims to simulate and evaluate attacks that modify lexical, syntactic, and structural features of code to confuse machine learning classifiers while retaining semantic correctness.  

The work contributes to understanding \*\*AI driven authorship verification\*\*, privacy protection, and defensive detection of obfuscated styles.
