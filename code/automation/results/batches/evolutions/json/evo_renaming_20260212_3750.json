These transformations must completely destroy consistent TF-IDF token patterns and stylometric features that Naive Bayes, SGD Classifier, and Neural Network models rely on, while preserving exact code functionality, targeting the specific weaknesses of these three models to achieve 75%+ evasion rate and stealth score below 0.5.",
